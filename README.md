Project Overview
This lab explores three popular UI frameworks/libraries:
1. Bootstrap (component-based CSS framework)
2. Tailwind CSS (utility-first CSS framework)
3. React.js (JavaScript library for building user interfaces)

Lab Components

1. Bootstrap Demo
Location: `bootstrap-demo/index.html`  
Features:
- Responsive navbar with dynamic time display
- Two-column layout (main content + sidebar)
- Breaking news alert component
- Article section with featured image
- Weather widget with refresh functionality
- News ticker with recent stories

Experience: 
Bootstrap made it easy to create a professional-looking news portal quickly. The grid system was particularly helpful for the two-column layout, and the pre-styled components saved us time. We enjoyed adding the dynamic time feature to make the page feel more alive.

2. Tailwind CSS Demo
Location: `tailwind-demo/index.html`  
Features:
- Responsive product card layout (2 columns on medium screens)
- Product cards with:
  - Sale/New badges
  - Rating stars
  - Price display
  - Stock level indicators
  - Add to cart buttons
- Hover effects for better interactivity

Experience: 
Tailwind's utility-first approach was different but powerful. We appreciated how we could style elements directly in the HTML without switching to a CSS file. The responsive design with `md:grid-cols-2` was straightforward to implement. The learning curve was steeper than Bootstrap, but the flexibility was rewarding.

3. React Demo
Location: `react-demo/` (CodeSandbox link)  
Features:
- Interactive task manager application
- Add new tasks with enter key or button
- Toggle task completion status
- Delete tasks
- Task counter showing completed/total tasks
- Visual feedback for completed tasks (line-through)

Experience:
React's component-based architecture made it easy to build the interactive task manager. Using `useState` to manage the task list was intuitive, and we liked how the UI automatically updated when state changed. The declarative approach felt more organized than manual DOM manipulation.
